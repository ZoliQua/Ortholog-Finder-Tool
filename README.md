# Ortholog-Finder-Tool

Project aim is to find the most relevant functional protein to a given list of proteins. Currently we are using five different species (A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe) for model organisms, while we integrated two orthologous and protein-protein (PPI) databases to our tool. Details can be found in the script and below.
